---

After pushing our final updates to the Chip8 master branch we are finally done with our preliminary phase!
s-society is proud to tell you that our new repository is online. The repository is named sharpboy and can be reached through this link [SharpBoy](https://www.github.com/s-society/sharpboy).
The repository is still a bit empty but the main structure for the emulator has been puch to the server and the README file has been updated.
More updates will come as we progress.
