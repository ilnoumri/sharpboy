We are a team of students at [EPITA](http://epita.fr) trying to build a F# GameBoy
emulator.

We're now done with this project, which we worked on during our second semester.

# Team

## Gabriel Duque

## Antoine Martin

I've been interested in computers since my childhood. After a failed attempt to
get into medical school I switched my focus to computer science which has always
been, if not a career choice at first, a hobby.

I'm passionate about Linux, Open Source Software, and pretty much everything which involves messing with computers.

This project is mainly a way for me to learn a lot about emulation and how the GameBoy's relatively simple system architecture works.
