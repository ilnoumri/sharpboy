We are a team of students at [EPITA](http://epita.fr) trying to build a F# GameBoy
emulator.

We're now done with this project, which we worked on during our second semester.

## Team

# Gabriel Duque

I have been passionate about Computer Science since I was a child. I am a very big Linux fan and hence an Open Source supporter. 
My favorite domain in IT is cyber-security and this project is mainly to acquire knowledge concerning Computer Science and more precisely about concerning how a CPU works.
The is the project I had to for school during my 2nd semester at EPITA, a french engineering school.
Thank you very much for checking out our project and I hope you had fun if you downloaded it !

I've been interested in computers since my childhood. After a failed attempt to
get into medical school I switched my focus to computer science which has always
been, if not a career choice at first, a hobby.

I'm passionate about Linux, Open Source Software, and pretty much everything which involves messing with computers.

This project is mainly a way for me to learn a lot about emulation and how the GameBoy's relatively simple system architecture works.

 Having joined EPITA in 2015 and having remade my S1, I come back with better bases in all subjects. We met with my friends for this exciting project! I have always liked the old consoles because we have all grown up with some as the Gameboy and we will now encode our first emulator. It is a pride for me to do this emulator project and I am, like my friends, hyper motivated to carry it out. The operation of the CPUs is very interesting and we all wanted to pay attention to it . I hope that this project will bring me enormous knowledge for the continuation of my schooling at EPITA. Moreover, the fact of making F # really interests me and it gives me the impression of a true challenge of project. I hope this project will please you as much as we liked.
 
That was my view of the beginning of the project. Today we have completed the project. We are proud of our work and I am personally pleased with what I have learned throughout the project. I am 20 years old now and it is with joy that we present to you our Sharpboy. After a few months of intense work, both on the Chip-8 and the emulation of the GameBoy, our two emulators have achieved our main goals.

I'm interested in computer sciences since my childhood and my first ever video-gane was on an emulator so to take part on this project is a real pleasure. I owned and spent some good times on my GameBoy when I was a kid and always wanted to know how my GameBoy worked. This project not only give me a glimpse on how a GameBoy worked but give me the opportunity to understand more about other consoles and some basic understanding on how a processor work and behave with other components of a system.

I'm also passionate about all kind of mobility technologies, virtualization technologies and networking.
