We are a team of students at [EPITA](http://epita.fr) trying to build a F# GameBoy
emulator.

We're now done with this project, which we worked on during our second semester.

## Team

# Gabriel Duque

# Antoine Martin

I've been interested in computers since my childhood. After a failed attempt to
get into medical school I switched my focus to computer science which has always
been, if not a career choice at first, a hobby.

I'm passionate about Linux, Open Source Software, and pretty much everything which involves messing with computers.

This project is mainly a way for me to learn a lot about emulation and how the GameBoy's relatively simple system architecture works.

You can find more about me on [my website](https://alarsyo.com).

I'm interested in computer sciences since my childhood and my first ever video-gane was on an emulator so to take part on this project is a real pleasure. I owned and spent some good times on my GameBoy when I was a kid and always wanted to know how my GameBoy worked. This project not only give me a glimpse on how a GameBoy worked but give me the opportunity to understand more about other consoles and some basic understanding on how a processor work and behave with other components of a system.

I'm also passionate about all kind of mobility technologies, virtualization technologies and networking.
