We're finishing the first phase of this project, which is to understand the
basic principles of emulation.

We've done this through a side project, the creation of a
[Chip 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator. The source code for
this project can be found here : [https://github.com/s-society/chip-8](https://github.com/s-society/chip-8)

Our Chip 8 emulator is currently in a functionning state, you can try it
yourself by cloning the repo ; the master branch should be working correctly.
You'll need Visual Studio and the F# runtime installed to run it.
