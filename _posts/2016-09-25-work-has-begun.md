We've started to work on a [Chip 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator.  
This will allow us to understand the basic concepts of emulation to prepare for our GameBoy project.

We'll also gain a better understanding of the F# programming language through this first project.

The code is available publicly on our repository [here](https://github.com/s-society/chip-8).
