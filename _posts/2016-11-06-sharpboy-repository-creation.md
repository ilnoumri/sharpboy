title: "SharpBoy repository is online!"
---
We've uploaded the structure of the SharpBoy to GitHub !

After pushing our final updates to the Chip8 master branch we are finally done with our preliminary phase!
S_Society is proud to tell you that our new repository is online. The repository is named sharpboy and can be reached through this link:  [SharpBoy](https://www.github.com/s-society/sharpboy).

The repository is still a bit empty but the main structure for the emulator has been pushed to the server and the README file has been updated.

More updates will come as we progress.
