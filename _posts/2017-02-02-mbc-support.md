SharpBoy now supports ROMs that use MBC technology !

This means that ROMs such as Zelda - Link's Awakening can now run on our emulator !

Obviously there's still a lot of work to do, but this is a big milestone in the development
of our project.

This release also marks the end of our second semester at EPITA, during which
we worked on this project. We will be evaluated based on this release.

You can download [the 0.2 release here.](https://github.com/s-society/sharpboy/releases/tag/v0.2)
