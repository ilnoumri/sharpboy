### - SharpBoy

This is the F# GameBoy emulator. Its code can be found [here](https://github.com/s-society/sharpboy).

The emulator isn't finished or even working yet, this is still a work in progress.

### - Chip 8

We've started our journey on the path to emulation with the creation of this simpler
Chip 8 emulator. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/s-society/chip-8)

You can go ahead and test it, you just need Visual Studio and the Visual F# tools.
